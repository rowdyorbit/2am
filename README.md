The gh-pages branch allows us to see a "live" build of the project. You must have an index.html file at the root of the directory. Look [HERE](https://pages.github.com/) to learn more about pages.

We will use this branch to test out our ideas and get feedback. Remember how we are setting up our projects:


```
.
├── index.html
├── assets
    ├── css
    ├── img
    └── js
```

This is an example of the [Materialize](http://materializecss.com/) framework.
