I would like you to look at the following templates that I have added to this repo. These are two popular CSS frameworks [Materialize](http://materializecss.com/getting-started.html) and [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com/sites/docs/). There are many other frameworks available and eventually you might end up creating your own! For now please clone these onto your machines and check out the index.html for each. There are a few more example websites on the frameworks websites for you to look at as well. The value of a framework is that it gives you a leg-up when starting a project, while also being very easy to customize. Play around with the elements (IN YOUR FREE TIME!). Thanks for the hard work!
